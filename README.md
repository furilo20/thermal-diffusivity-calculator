# thermal-diffusivity-calculator

App made to receive data via BLE with temperatures and then calculate thermal diffusivity and generate a graphic which show the ramp.

Was made in android studio and only works in Android phone.

In folder esp32 has code for dev module read two temperature sensors and send values in ble.

Good Luck!
